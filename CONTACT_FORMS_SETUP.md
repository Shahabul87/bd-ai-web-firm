# 📧 Contact Forms Setup Guide

Your contact forms are now fully functional! Here's how to complete the setup so people can actually contact you.

## ✅ What's Already Working

- **Contact Form** (`/components/ContactSection.tsx`) - Simple contact form
- **Quote Form** (`/quote` page) - Multi-step enterprise quote request form
- **API Endpoints** - Backend handlers for both forms
- **Validation & Security** - Input sanitization and validation
- **Error Handling** - Proper error messages and user feedback

## 🚀 Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Copy Environment File
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

### Step 2: Configure Email Settings
Edit `.env.local` and add your email configuration:

```env
# Your email where messages will be sent
CONTACT_EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com

# Gmail SMTP settings (recommended)
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-app-password
```

### Step 3: Set Up Gmail App Password
1. Enable 2-factor authentication on your Gmail account
2. Go to [Google Account Settings > Security > App passwords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)
3. Generate an app password for "Mail"
4. Use that password in `SMTP_PASSWORD` (not your regular Gmail password)

### Step 4: Restart Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

## 📧 How It Works

```
